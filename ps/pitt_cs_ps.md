My name is Wang Zhendong, a chinese boy who loves software development. I used to be a student of statistics, but my ineterest of software finally drove me to become a developer by self-learning. Now, I'm a senior application developer working in Citibank for 2 years. Though I'm quite comfortable with current work, I always have a dream that one day I could learn more advanced CS knowledge and technology. That's why I apply for this fantastic master program.

I first got my interest in software development when I was working as an intern in BASF. I developed a little automatic reporting generation system there and helped my collegues get rid of the time-consuming manual report works. On the one hand, I was excited to realize how powerful can software be to help us work more efficiently. On the other hand, I also realized how difficult to design and build a robust system. Though with very limit CS knowledge, I think it's a good option for me to choose software development as my future career. I soon start my self-learning plan for all the basic things like OO programming, database design, client and server programming for web apps etc. Though the process is not easy, I'm happy with them.


In 2013, after I graduated from school, I started my first job working on a startup project, which is to build an real-time testing tool for digital chips. One of the main difficulty in this project is we need to show our user the data in both real-time dashboard and plot system with as little delay as possible. Since the data is collected from chips in a high frequency, a high performance asynchoronous data processing framework is deadly needed. I was in charge of the design for this module and it was very challenge. I began my first step by reading many articles and books about multi-thread programming, I learn how to use different lock, how to write thread-safe class and some classical design patterns for multi-thread programming. Then I tried to do serveral prototypes by using different models. After trying and trying, I realized the core solution for this issue is I need to decompose my data processing into reasonable separate steps and try to parallel them run together. I also try to encapsulate the reusable logic inside self-made thread-safe classes and let the whole architecture clearly and explicityly reflected in our code. With reasonable design, The  module's performance finally proved to be very good! There are many other interesting challenges I met during this project and all of them triggered me to learn more advanced knowledge like enterprise software architecture, test driven development, domain driven development etc. In my heart, I believe there are better ways to develop complex software by learning more advanced technology and practice them in real world. To experience more challenge projects, I choose to join Citibank in 2014.

In Citibank, I become mroe mature in software development. As a senior developer, I think not only how to implement a new function but also whether the function is well designed and easy to understand by my colleagues. I also try to use advanced techonology like meta-programming and model-driven-development in my daily work. In last year, I design a high performance parsing framework  which can let user using GUI to pick up fields they want from different data source like xml, json, excel etc without writing any code! All the concrete implementation is generated by a meta-program by using user's selection and meta-data from sample files. Also, user don't need to write their own logic to parsing large volumne data more efficiently since the framework will tuning the performance and generate high performance execution plan according to the data structure. In one word, the user only needs to care their business logic and the framework will take care of the rest. With its good performance, the framework won an 10000RMB reward in '2015 Citigroup find an talent innovation competition'. I even got the 3rd highest techonology score from the totally 120 projects. 

I first spent my last year in university To learn more, I spent my last year in university learning basic things like OO design and OO programming language, advanced things like enterprise software architecture and domain driven development. I also learn many popular framework like Spring, AngularJS, Hibernate etc. In 2014, I passed the very competitve 10%-passed interview of Citibank and work as a senior developer until now.
