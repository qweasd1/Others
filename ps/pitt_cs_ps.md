My name is Wang Zhendong, a chinese boy who loves software development. I used to be a student of statistics, but my ineterest of software finally drove me to become a developer by self-learning. Now, I'm working as a senior developer in Citibank for 2 years. Though I'm quite comfortable with current work, I always have a dream that one day I could learn more advanced CS knowledge and technology. That's why I apply this master program.
